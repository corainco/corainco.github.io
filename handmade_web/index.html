	  <strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software;</strong> web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.
